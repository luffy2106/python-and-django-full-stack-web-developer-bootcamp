### 2. How web work ? \
####  Full stack :
#####  Front-End : 
- HTML, CSS, Javascript. 
- JQuery allows you to easily manipulate the contents of an HTML document by manipulating elements, classes, and IDs, while HTML allows you to only display the content of a webpage.
- Bootstrap : contains CSS- and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components
- The differencen between CSS and HTML: The main difference between CSS and HTML is that CSS is used to style and layout web pages while HTML is used for the structure and content of a web page. In other words, HTML contains the information about the web page (text, images, media, etc.) while CSS determines how that information is displayed to users.
- Javascript allows you to add interactiity to the websit, including programming logic.
##### Back_end:
- The language : Python
- The framework : Django
- The database : SQLite

 
#### 3. HTML basics
* structure
* basic taggings : head, body, title, text style ..  (https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/default.asp)
* Lists:
- odrder list
- unordered list
* Nested list
* <div> and <span> tags
The <div> and <span> elements are structural elements used to create divisions and sections within an HTML document. The <div> element is a generic container which can be used for any purpose - it is generally used for larger divisions of content, such as sections of a page. The <span> element is used for smaller sections of content, such as a single word or phrase, and it does not set apart the content from other sections of the same document.

Both elements can have attributes, such as a id attribute which can be used for styling with CSS. They can also contain text, images, and other elements 
* Attributes
- Add more information to HTML tags. Ex : link or referencing an image ...

### 4. HTML advanced

- CSS describe how HTML elements are displayed on the page
- we can either define styling inside an HTML file or create .css file and then link to the html file.

* CSS level one part four

If you want to see page in html code, right click and choose "inspect". The elements of html is on the left and Css styles is on the right.

* CSS level one part five

CSS specificity : It defines the hierarchy of CSS styling and what types of tags overrule. To be more specific:

CSS specificity refers to how browsers determine which CSS rules get applied to an element. When two overlapping rules apply to the same element, the browser needs to know which one to pick. This is known as specificity. Generally speaking, the more specific a rule is, the greater priority it has over another less specific rule.

In order to prevent confusion and ensure that all of your intended rules are correctly applied, it's important to keep track of each element's specificity. This could include looking at how many classes and IDs are applied and which are more closely related to the element in question

For example: If we want to set color for the top priority items instead of all items.
